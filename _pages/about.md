About me:
======
I am a skilled bioinformatics scientist with 10+ years of experience in large-scale NGS data analysis with focus on cancer biology. I am particularly interested in the integration of large-scale multi omics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic) data and designing data-driven solutions to answer the fundamental research questions for drug discovery. 

- A recognized genomics expert (30+ peer-reviewed publications, Co-investigator on multiple research grants) who work closely with bench scientists and make contributions in the area of experimental design, hypothesis generation, and follow-up studies.
- Proficient in data processing, analyses and interpretation of NGS workflows for RNAseq (Bulk, single-cell RNAseq and Spatial transcriptomics, TTseq), DNAseq (WGS/WES variant discovery), functional genomics (CRISPR, miRNA), epigenomics (ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq), Databases (TCGA, CCLE, GEO, NCBI).
- Co-manage the bioinformatics core facility to support 20+ faculty members across the Purdue University and Indiana University.
- Designed custom computational biology pipelines and integrated data visualization solutions using HPC Linux environment, R, Python and Nextflow.
